    How-to Build sources 
====================================================================


  ./configure            - Configure the build environment and create makefiles.
                           Do './configure -h' to view available configure options.

  make                   - Compile all OpenVSX and OpenVCX sources.

  make installer-build   - Create a self-extracting executable which will install
                           both OpenVCX and OpenVSX.

  To install on your system run the self-extracting executable from a shell.  The install script 
  will perform first-time configuration.  You do not need root privileges to install or run.

  ./dist/linux_x86_32/openvcx_linux_x86_32_v1.x.x.bxxx.bin

  'make openvsx' is used to build OpenVSX (Video Streaming Processor) source 
  found in vsx/.

  'make openvcx' is used to build OpenVCX (Video Conferencing Server) source 
  found in vcx/mobicents-sip/.  
  This is the same as calling the ant build script 'build.sh deploy all' 
  found in vcx/mobicents-sip/ to build OpenVCX java source.

  Use 'packaging/pkg_vsx_linux_x86_32.sh' or 'packaging/pkg_vsx_mac_x86_64.sh'
  to manually create an OpenVSX (Video Streaming Processor) tarball package.

  Use packaging/pkg_all.sh to create a self-extracting binary for 
  either Linux or Mac OSX which will install both OpenVCX and OpenVSX.

    Troubleshooting:
====================================================================


  =====  Running on 64bit linux hosts

  The OpenVSX binary distribution should be able to run on most major flavors of
  32 or 64 bit linux distributions based on x86 architecture. Â For 64bit
  systems you will need to have installed 32bit library support for your
  system.

  On CentOS / Fedora / RedHat systems you can typically do this with:

  sudo yum install ia32-libs

  or

  sudo yum install glibc.i686

  On Ubuntu / Debian systems you can typically do this with:

  sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

  If vsx still fails to start you should check if all library dependancies
  are fulfilled with the following command:

  ldd ./bin/vsxbin
